# ***pyXclTodoManager***
Manages TODOs and the reminders for them in much more flexible way compared to other calendars like outlook.
The TODOs can be entered directly in the excel sheet in the format expected or use a command line interface to enter the details for the TODO.

Uses openpyxl to manipulate the excel and pyautogui for windows control and pymsgbox for reminder pop-ups
